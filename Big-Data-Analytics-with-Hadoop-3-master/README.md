## About the Book
Apache Hadoop is the most popular platform for big data processing, and can be combined with a host of other big data tools to build powerful analytics solutions. Big Data Analytics with Hadoop 3 shows you how to do just that, by providing insights into the software as well as its benefits with the help of practical examples.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
hadoop fs -mkdir /hbase/coprocessor hadoop fs -put hadoop-yarn-servertimelineservice-hbase-3.0.0-alpha1-SNAPSHOT.jar /hbase/coprocessor/hadoopyarn-server-timelineservice.jar
```

The examples have been implemented using Scala, Java, R, and Python on a Linux 64-bit.
